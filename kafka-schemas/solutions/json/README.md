# Bank Account Sample App

This is a minimal Quarkus application that simulates the intranet application of a Bank.

Features:
- Panache (active record) for simple persistence.
- H2 for the persistence.
- REST API.
- Basic front-end in Angular.

## Running the Application

You can run the application in local like any other Quarkus project:

```bash
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```

The application exposes a web interface to interact with the application.
