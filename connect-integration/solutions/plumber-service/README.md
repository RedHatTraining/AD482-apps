# WaterLeak Inc. - Plumbers

This is a minimal Quarkus application that simulates an intranet application that keeps plumber service records.

Features:
- Panache (active record) for simple persistence.
- Postgres for the persistence.
- REST API.
- Basic front-end in Angular.

## Running the Application

You can run the application in local like any other Quarkus project:

```bash
./mvnw package quarkus:dev
```

The application exposes a web interface to interact with the application.
